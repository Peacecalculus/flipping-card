# 3D Flip Card (Image)

A small, lightweight demo showcasing a responsive 3D flip card effect using only **HTML** and **CSS**. Hover or tap the card to see a smooth 3D flip revealing a back side — perfect for portfolios, product cards, or small UI demos. ✅

## How to Customize 💡

- Change the images: replace `images/*` with your files and update the `src` in `card.html`.
- Card size: edit the dimensions in `htmlcss/style.css` (look for width/height variables or the `.card` rules).
- Flip direction: modify transform rules in `htmlcss/style.css` (rotateX / rotateY) to change the flip axis.
- Styling: adjust background colors, fonts, and shadow to match your design system.
